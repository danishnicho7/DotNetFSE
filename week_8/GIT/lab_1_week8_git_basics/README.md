# Lab 1 – Git Basics

## Objective
To learn and apply the fundamental Git commands required for version control, including creating files, staging changes, committing, and pushing to a remote repository.

## Goal
- Understand the purpose of Git for tracking changes  
- Learn how to stage and commit files  
- Push changes to a remote GitHub repository

## Prerequisites
- Git installed on the system  
- GitHub account and repository set up  
- VS Code installed

## Components Used
- **Git** – for version control  
- **GitHub** – for remote repository hosting  
- **VS Code** – for editing and managing the project files

## Method Used
1. Create a text file named `welcome.txt` containing a sample message.  
2. Stage the file using `git add welcome.txt`.  
3. Commit the change with `git commit -m "Add welcome.txt"`.  
4. Push the commit to the remote repository using `git push`.

## Uses
- Tracks changes in the project efficiently  
- Enables collaboration through GitHub  
- Maintains a clean commit history

## Output
The `welcome.txt` file is visible in the GitHub repository with the committed message.

## Conclusion
This lab introduced the basic Git workflow, helping in understanding file staging, committing, and pushing changes to a remote repository.
