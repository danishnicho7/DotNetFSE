## Objective

- Define JSX
- Explain about ECMA Script
- Explain React.createElement()
- Explain how to create React nodes with JSX
- Define how to render JSX to DOM
- Explain how to use JavaScript expressions in JSX
- Explain how to use inline CSS in JSX

---

## Goal

To create a React application that uses JSX syntax, object mapping, and inline styling to display office space rental information dynamically.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- NPM installed
- Visual Studio Code
- Basic understanding of React and JSX

---

## Components/Concepts Used

- **JSX**: JavaScript XML syntax used to create React elements.
- **JavaScript expressions**: Used inside JSX to evaluate variables and logic.
- **Object and Array mapping**: Rendering dynamic lists from object arrays.
- **Conditional inline CSS**: Changing rent text color based on value.
- **Image rendering**: Displaying static images using JSX attributes.

---

## Definitions & Usage

- **JSX**: A syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript. It gets transpiled to `React.createElement()`.
- **React.createElement()**: Core method to create virtual DOM elements manually (JSX is syntactic sugar over this).
- **JavaScript expressions in JSX**: Embedding variables and logic inside `{}`.
- **Inline CSS in JSX**: Styling directly via `style={{}}` with conditional logic.
- **Object mapping**: Iterating over an array of office objects to render multiple elements.

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how JSX helps in building UI with React by:
- Creating elements and attributes dynamically
- Embedding logic and expressions
- Applying inline conditional styles
- Rendering structured data through mapping

It helped reinforce core ES6 and React JSX concepts essential for frontend development.
