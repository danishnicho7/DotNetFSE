# Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

## Scenario:
You are working on the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.

## Steps Taken:

### 1. Understand Asymptotic Notation:
- Explained Big O notation and its importance in analyzing algorithm efficiency.
- Described best, average, and worst-case scenarios specifically in the context of search operations.

### 2. Setup:
- Created a class `Product` with relevant attributes for searching, such as `productId`, `productName`, and `category`.

### 3. Implementation:
- Implemented **linear search** for unsorted product arrays.
- Implemented **binary search** on a sorted array of products for optimized performance.

### 4. Analysis:
- Compared time complexities:
  - Linear Search: O(n)
  - Binary Search: O(log n)
- Concluded that **binary search** is more suitable for large datasets due to its logarithmic time performance, given the data is sorted.

## Output:
A search module that demonstrates the differences in performance between linear and binary search when used on product data. The system showcases how efficient searching improves user experience on an e-commerce platform.
